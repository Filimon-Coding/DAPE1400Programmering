A college offers a course that prepares students for the state licensing exam for real-estate
brokers. Last year, ten of the students who completed this course took the exam. The col-
lege wants to know how well its students did on the exam. You’ve been asked to write a
program to summarize the results. You’ve been given a list of these 10 students. Next to
each name is written a 1 if the student passed the exam or a 2 if the student failed.
